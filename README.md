# Using Local LLMs and RAG for Content Promotion

This repository contains the code that was shown in the [3/21/2024 meeting](https://www.meetup.com/saint-louis-unix-users-group/events/298136389/) of the [St. Louis Linux Users Group](https://stllug.sluug.org/).

An archive of the presentation (Video and Slides) is available [here](https://www.sluug.org/resources/presentations/body.html#a2024).

## Running Locally

I set this repository up using [Rye](https://rye-up.com/). To run it locally, install Rye, clone the repository, then run `rye sync` in the project directory. I suspect any other python package managers that know about the `pyproject.toml` file will also work, but I've only tested it using Rye.
