## MAIN Presentation

The MAIN presentation on March 10th, 2021 was titled: The Raku (Perl 6) language.

The presenter was Steven Lembark.

The presentation abstract was as follows:
"Hypers and Gathers and Takes! Oh my!"

Raku is the new name (since 2019) for Perl 6 (out since 2015). Perl 6 took YEARS in anticipation and when it finally came out, it was very different from older versions of Perl. So much so, they gave up on the name Perl 6 and just went with a new name, RAKU.
