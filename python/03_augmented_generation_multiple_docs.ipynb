In the process, we'll touch on many of the git objects that make those parts ( e.g. files/folders, commits, branches, SHAs, etc. ). And we'll do that by creating and modifying a project from scratch, using git to manage the changes. By the end, you will have a good basic understanding of how to use git to work on your own projects to then branch into more advanced uses of git.\n",

We will then dig into how git implements and uses those abstractions to create a version control system using files and the file system. We will walk through examples of using the back-end commands to build a commit history just like git does.
